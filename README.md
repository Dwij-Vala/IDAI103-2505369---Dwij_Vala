## 📌 Project Overview  

CoachBot AI is a Generative AI-powered web application designed to provide personalized fitness coaching, tactical advice, injury-aware training modifications, and nutrition guidance for youth athletes.  

The system simulates a certified elite youth performance coach using AI and generates structured, safe, and goal-oriented training programs.

The application adapts outputs based on:

- Sport and position  
- Experience level  
- Injury history  
- Pain level  
- Risk tolerance  
- Training mode  
- Performance goals  

This project demonstrates practical application of Generative AI in sports development and youth performance optimization.

## 🌍 Problem Definition  

Many young athletes lack access to professional coaching, structured training plans, and injury-aware conditioning systems.  

Common issues include:

- Overtraining  
- Poor recovery  
- Increased injury risk  
- Improper nutrition planning  
- Lack of tactical awareness  

CoachBot AI addresses these challenges by generating personalized weekly training plans, tactical advice, and nutrition strategies while prioritizing safety and structured development.

## 🔬 Research & Conceptual Foundation  

The project was influenced by research in:

- Youth athletic development models  
- Periodization and load management principles  
- Injury prevention frameworks  
- Sports nutrition planning  
- AI-based personalized recommendation systems  

Key insights implemented:

- Training must adapt to injury severity  
- Structured weekly plans improve performance consistency  
- Nutrition should align with athletic goals  
- Mental preparation enhances match performance  
- AI prompts must enforce structured output formatting  

---

## 🤖 AI Model Used  

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)  
**Accessed via:** OpenAI Python SDK  

The model was selected because it:

- Provides structured and coherent outputs  
- Supports temperature-based creativity control  
- Handles complex multi-section generation  
- Produces consistent formatting for parsing  

---

## 🎯 Prompt Engineering Strategy  

The system uses structured prompting that includes:

- Defined AI persona ("Certified Elite Youth Performance Coach")  
- Athlete profile embedding  
- Mode-based training adjustment  
- Injury-aware constraints  
- Strict output format enforcement  

The model is instructed to return structured sections:

```
=== WEEKLY PLAN ===
Monday:
Tuesday:
Wednesday:
Thursday:
Friday:
Saturday:
Sunday:

=== POSITION DRILLS ===
=== TACTICAL ADVICE ===
=== NUTRITION PLAN ===
=== RECOVERY PROTOCOL ===
=== MENTAL PREPARATION ===
=== SAFETY NOTES ===
```

This ensures consistency and allows parsing for data visualization.
